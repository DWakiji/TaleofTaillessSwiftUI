## Introduction

This project is a SwiftUI-based interactive story template that allows you to create and present a story with multiple chapters. Each chapter includes an image and text, and readers can navigate through the story by clicking "Next" and "Go Back" buttons.

## Chapter Structure

The story is divided into chapters, each represented by a SwiftUI View. Here's an overview of the chapters included in this template:

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to the main character, Damian, and his self-centered nature.
- **Chapter 2**: Damian's transformation and exile from his squirrel village.
- **Chapter 3**: Damian's 40-day journey into the forest, where he learns valuable lessons.
- **Chapter 4**: Damian returns to his village, sharing his newfound wisdom.

Each chapter includes an image and a piece of text that advances the story. The navigation between chapters is handled through SwiftUI's `@State` properties.
